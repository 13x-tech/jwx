=======

v2 has many incompatibilities with v1. To see the full list of differences between
v1 and v2, please read the Changes.v2 file (https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/blob/develop/v2/Changes-v2.md)

v2.0.0-beta2 - 16 Apr 2022
[jwk]
  * Added `jwk.CachedSet`, a shim over `jwk.Cache` that allows you to
    have to write wrappers around `jwk.Cache` that retrieves a particular
    `jwk.Set` out of it. You can use it to, for example, pass `jwk.CachedSet`
    to a `jws.Verify`

      cache := jwk.NewCache(ctx)
      cache.Register(ctx, jwksURL)
      cachedSet := jwk.NewCachedSet(cache, jwksURL)
      jws.Verify(signed, jws.WithKeySet(cachedSet))

v2.0.0-beta1 - 09 Apr 2022
[Miscellaneous]
  * Renamed Changes.v2 to Changes-v2.md
  * Housecleaning for lint action.
  * While v2 was not affected, ported over equivalent test for #681 to catch
    regressions in the future.
  * Please note that there is no stability guarantees on pre-releases.

v2.0.0-alpha1 - 04 Apr 2022
  * Initial pre-release of v2 line. Please note that there is no stability guarantees
    on pre-releases.
