Changes
=======

v1.0.0 -
  * All packages (`jws`, `jwe`, `jwk`, `jwt`) have all been reworked from
	  the ground-up.
  * These packages now hide the actual implementation of the main structs behind an interface.
	  * These structs must now be instantiated using proper constructors
		  (most notably, json.Unmarshal will miserably fail if you just pass
			 and empty interface via `xxx.Token` or similar)
		* Fields are no longer directly accessible: You must use accessors
  * Many helper functions and structs have been unexported. They were never
    meant to be anything useful for end-users, and hopefully it does not
	  cause any problems.
  * All main structs now have a common, uniform `Iterate`, `Walk`, and `AsMap` methods
  * `jwt` package can now work with different token types, such as OpenID tokens.
	* `jwk` API have been reworked:
		* `jwk.ParseKey` has been added
		* `jwk.Materialize` has been renamed to `Raw()`. A new corresponding
		  method to initialize the key from a raw key (RSA/ECDSA/byte keys)
	    has also been added

v0.9.2 - 15 Apr 2020 
  * Maintenance release to protect users from upcoming breaking changes

v0.9.1 - 27 Feb 2020
  * Fix error wrapping in certain cases
	* Add Claims(), Walk(), and AsMap() to iterate claims, as well as
    getting the entire data out as a single map
  * Work with alternate base64 encodings when decoding

v0.9.0 - 22 May 2019
  * Start tagging versions for good measure.
